# Timer

When this project is finished it will be a working interval timer in which the use can set the number of repetitions necessary as well as alternating countdown times.

For example, if the user wants 5 rounds of 30 seconds alternating with rounds of 20 seconds the timer could be set to 10 repetitions that start with a 30 second countdown and then switches to a 20 second countdown. After the 10 repetitions are complete the timer will stop.
